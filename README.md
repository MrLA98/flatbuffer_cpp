# Flatbuffers in cpp

Brief: According to the schema of the flatbuffers official website, a simple attempt was made to complete the project: a series of processes of defining, creating, serializing, writing to disk, and deserializing a flatbuffer object after reading the disk

## Whole Workflow
### 1. `.fbs` file definition
wip
### 2. serialization of a flatbuffers obj
wip
### 3. write into and read from a disk file
wip
### 4. deserialization and access member
wip

# create dir
